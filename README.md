# 1. Agile: Driven Design and Development
## 1.1 Agility
In software development, agile is a paradigm/philosophy to design and driven development of software.
We are going to identify some keywords relevant to our experience:
- `DevOps`: Combination of software development and, IT operation means continuous delivery (CD).
For me it not an agile method but a complement since delivery operation is include in the driven of software development as same in the team. 
- `Scrum`: Manage Workflow
- `Increment`: CI, BDD, DDD, User Story, Epic
- `Iteration`: Sprint, Planing, Review, Refinement, Retrospective, Refractory 
- `Collaboration`: Team (PO, Scrum Master, Dev, Designer, Tester etc.)

By experience, `Design` and `Development` are notables operations to drive production of software in agile method scrum.
Let us explore concepts used to implement these two operations.

## 1.2 Design Patterns
* **Object-oriented analysis and design**: 
it exploits the concepts as `Entity`, `Aggregate`, `Encapsulation`, `Composition`, `Methode`, `Object`, `Polymorphism` etc. Bref higher architectural level.
* **Aspect-oriented design**: 
Introduce concept of `cross-cutting concerns` such as security, transaction management, logging to increase modularity and letting them focus purely on the business logic.
* **[Model Driven Design](https://www.todaysoftmag.com/article/1529/model-driven-design-theory-to-practice)**: 
It describes what a Conceptual Model is and how it is linked with the Problem Model/Domain Model/Business Model/Data Model etc.
* **[Domain Driven Design](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-drivendesign-quickly)**: It is a pattern which support on 3 principles. 

(1) Focus on the core domain and domain logic. That's means an area of concern from the problem called `Problem Domain`. Eg: Banking, Agriculture, Manifacture etc. 

(2) Design on a model of the domain. That's means create a model which is deeply rooted in the domain. That is done by splitting the problem it into sub-problems, depending on the concerns. 
This is done by extracting all the key concepts of the sub problems and linking them together.

(3) Collaboration between software specialists and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems in order to create a good model.

A common architectural solution for domain-driven designs contain four conceptual layers:

1.**User Interface(Presentation Layer)**

Responsible for presenting information to the user and interpreting user commands.

2.**Application Layer**

This is a thin layer which coordinates the application activity. It does not contain business logic. 
It does not hold the state of the business objects, but it can hold the state of an application task progress.

3.**Domain Layer**

This layer contains information about the domain. This is the heart of the business software. The state of business objects is held here. 
Persistence of the business objects and possibly their state is delegated to the infrastructure layer.

4.**Infrastructure Layer**

This layer acts as a supporting library for all the other layers. It provides communication between layers, implements persistence for business objects, contains supporting libraries for the user interface layer, etc.

## 1.3 Development Patterns
* **Object-oriented programing**: It is programming pattern preceded by analysis, design and modeling. All base on the object-oriented paradigm.
* **Aspect-oriented programming**: It is modular programming pattern which add additional behavior to existing code without modifying the code itself.
* **Test Driven Development**: Software development process relying on business requirements are converted to test cases before development. 
It promotes software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
* **[Behavior Driven Development](https://blog.octo.com/architecture-hexagonale-trois-principes-et-un-exemple-dimplementation/)**: 
It emerged from TDD and combines the general techniques and principles of OOP and DDD. 
The particularity for BDD is that business requirements are translated into functional/feature testing case as human-readable text by non-technical team members (QA/Test, Business Analysis, PO, Domain Experts).

# 2.Behavior Driven Development
Behavior Driven Development or BDD illustrates the methods of developing a feature or user story based on its behavior.
The behavior is basically explained in a simple language which can be understood by all the collaborators â€“ both technical and non-technical people (Dev, Ops, QA, PO, BA, Expert) to write feature requirements, constraints and, test scenarios.

## 2.1 Standard approach to conduct BDD
![Standard approach to conduct BDD](bdd-workflow.PNG)
## 2.1.1 Collaborators
The collaborators explain and provide the feature/business requirements, acceptances criteria of the user stories as test cases for verification of system behavior. 
The key element in this layer is `feature file` which describes the feature requirements in natural human language.
We will use the syntax called [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) base on the pattern `Given-When-Then` for feature definition.
* `Given` - Sets the scene and initialises what objects needed for test.
* `When` - Think like action or activity you perform.
* `Then` - Think like comparing your expected results with application results.

## 2.1.2 Testing Tools
To develop application with the pattern BDD need to use a test framework tools to write, execute and automate tests. Developers build test logic in program code and map to each statement in the feature files to form automated test cases.
We can use the popular tool [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/) to bind feature files and program code and run the test cases.

## 2.1.3 Target Application
The target application run normally as black box side of user. A testing tool send requests to the application and get responses. Then, build and send test report to collaborators.

## 2.2 How to implement BDD Approach?
They are many tools available for implementing BDD. 
* Cucumber
* Fitnesse
* Concordion
* JBehave
* Spec Flow

We will use `Cucumber` for java and `Spring Framework` in our case. To do this, we must describe a Problem and its potential implement Solution.

# 3. Case study
## 3.1 Compagny overview
Biblio has arount 50 libraries in ten regions. Biblio want to make online service through platform where:
* A visitor can access the platform and do searches.
* Only subscribers can read a book online or borrow a book.
* A subscriber cannot borrow more than 3 books.
* The search can be simple or advanced.

## 3.2 Design pattern
We going to use `Domain Driven Design` call **DDD** as explain in the book **Domain Driven Design Quickly** by Abel Avram and Floyd Marinescu.
We summarize design into 3 keys approaches.
### 3.2.1 Building domain knowledge
Start to understand domain before start software developpement perspective by.
- Identify domain specialist not system designer or software specialist to complete description of the problem domain.
- Design is done around discussion with software specialist, architect, developer and domain experts.
Then, transform discussion knowledge from the domain expert into a useful form.
- Create a prototype or mock.
The goal of this exercice it's to design model of the domain.

Come back to our study case, let us define:
- **Domain**: as Online library
- **Problem domain**: Search - Read - Borrow book(s) online.
- **Sub-Problem**:
    - **Search book(s) online**: What is the search criterias? For advanced search we need to specify category, title or author, editor and date of publish.
    For standard search, we can fill unique reference book number.
    - **Read book(s) online**: The reader can have the books currenly in reading. He can write the notes during reading and see the previous notes. He can plan a reading.
    - **Borrow book(s) online**: The subcribe can borrow a book which not availble online. We will consider the availibilty of the book by other subcribes.
    In this case fill the date of borrow. The borrow should not extend 2 weeks. Otherwise after 3 months the subcribe should buy the book.
    
### 3.2.2 Creating the ubiquitous language
Every person who participate to the discussion have its language or jargon style. So that can make a fundamental communication barrier.
We need for a common language without design can be wrong when team members don't share a common language for discussing the domain.
Thus, use the language base on the model, domain specific modeling laguage (DSML), UML etc.

### 3.2.3 Model driven design (MDD)
The purpose of this modeling process is to create a good model by technical designer. The next step is to implement the model in code by developer using OOP suitable.
In fact, it's usually done by different people. Any domain can be expressed with many models, and any model can be expressed in various ways in code.

As the key domain concepts should be use in the model, let us present some of the key elements of object modeling from the viewpoint of model-driven design.
![The Building Blocks of a Model-Driven-Design](object-modeling.PNG)

#### 3.2.3.1 Entity objects (key concept)
- Unique Identity
- Avoid data corruption
- Keep the state of object means have continuity and identity which remains unchanged thoughout the life of the system (memory object, data base, archive)

So implement an entity means create an identity. Entity are important objects of a domain model, and they should be considered from the beginning of the modeling process.

Take attention on tracking and creating identity because comes with a cost. A wrong decission would lead to objects with same identity.
There are also performance implications in making object entities.
- System performance degradation when dealing with thowsand or billion of instances to load into memory
- Tracking identity must be simple and optimize.

#### 3.2.3.2 Value objects (key concept)
An object that is used to describe certain aspects of a domain, and which does not have identity, is named Value Object.
- Having no identity
- Can be easily created and discarded
- Garbage collector takes care of the object when is no longer referenced by any other oject
- Recommended to be immutable if it should be shared

#### 3.2.3.3 Services (verb/functionality)
When such a behavior is recognized in the domain, the best practice is to declare it as a Service.
- Such an object does not have an internal state, and its purpose is to simply provide statless functionalities/operations for the domain, which serves the entities and the value objects.
- It encapsulates a concept. Not remplace the operations which normally belongs on domain objects (entities and value objects).
- Act as interfaces which provide operation refers to other objects in the domain.

While using Services, is important to keep the domain layer isolated. 
It is easy to get confused between services which belong to the domain layer, and those belonging to the infrastructure or application layer.

A high degree of coupling between many objects is a sign of poor design because it makes the code difficult to read and understand, and more importantly, it makes it difficult to change.

#### 3.2.3.4 Modules
For a large and complex application, the model tends to grow bigger and bigger. 
The model reaches a point where it is hard to talk about as a whole, and understanding the relationships and interactions between different parts becomes difficult. 
For that reason, it is necessary to organize the model into modules.

Code quality. high level of cohesion and a low level of coupling.
- **Communicational cohesion**: it is achieved when parts of the module operate on the same data.
- **Functional cohesion**: it is achieved when all parts of the module work together to perform a well-defined task.
- **Low coupling** reduces complexity, and increases maintainability. It appear when there are few connections between modules.

#### 3.2.3.5 Domain objects life cycle
Another part of modeling challenge, is the life cycle of domain objects. 
If it is not done properly, it may have a negative impact on the domain model. 

Domain objects go through a set of states during their life time, generally represent by this state diagram

We will present three patterns which help us deal with it.
- **Aggregate** is a domain pattern used to define object ownership and boundaries.
- **Factories** is design patterns which help us deal with object creation.
- **Repositories** is design patterns which help us deal with object storage.

## 3.3 Driven development 
### 3.3.1 Configuration
We are going to separate unit tests to integration tests and bdd tests.
* Unit Test: we just use Junit 5 to test some method of a bean.
* Integration Test: We use Spring Boot Test with its own configuration to test a component which depends on many beans.
* Acceptance Test: We use Cucumber for java to run acceptance criteria define in feature file as Gherkin syntax.

Let us give a particular attention on Cucumber configuration. As our design is based on DDD, we will have a configuration by a domain.
Let us define XXX as a domain. We will have:
* **CucumberSpringConfig**: Cucumber glue class to load spring context configuration.
* **ContextResetHook**: To reset spring context configuration using `Scenario hooks` (Before, After etc.) at various points in the Cucumber execution cycle.
* **AbstractStepDefinition**: The main cucumber and spring boot test configuration to run steps definitions of features of a domain.
* **XXXCucumberHook**: it used to set up typically a spring context of components of a domain using `Scenario hooks` at various points in the Cucumber execution cycle.
* **XXXCucumberTestRunner**: To configure cucumber runner of features for a domain.
* **XXXTestConfig**: Spring test configuration of components.
